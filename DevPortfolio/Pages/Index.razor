        <p class="text-start">
            Hi, I’m Paul Saltzman — an aspiring full-stack developer with a unique blend of design, software support, and database experience.
        </p>
        <p class="text-start">
            I began my career with a degree in Graphic Design and several years in web design, which gave me a strong foundation in building clean, user-friendly interfaces. 
            For the past 13 years, I’ve worked in software support, where I’ve gained a deep experience and understanding of business systems, troubleshooting, and working closely with data.
            In my role, I work with Microsoft SQL Server, MariaDB, and DB2, where I’ve learned database structure and written reports to support business needs.
            Over the last 3 years, I’ve been expanding my skills into software development, including creating a data conversion program at my current job.
            My goal is to bridge the gap between design, data, and development by moving into full-time, full-stack development, bringing together creativity,
            problem-solving, and technical knowledge.
        </p>
        <p class="text-start">
            Outside of coding, I enjoy blacksmithing, 3D printing, tinkering with my home server, and walking my dogs. These hobbies fuel my curiosity and creativity — the same qualities I bring into my professional growth as a developer.
        </p>
